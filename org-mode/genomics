- You need to have nice figures
  - axes need to be labelled
  - axes need units
  - clearly labelled legend
  - Other info about the figure in the caption. *Use concise, short captions.*

We're not expected to do runtime analysis, though we can.
Describe in simple english, what the algorithm does, step by step.

- Clearly define your algorithms
- Clearly define your experiments
- Reproducibility is the last subsection, but there could be other subsections as needed.
*** Reproducibility
Clearly show the commands needed to reproduce the results, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone blah blah blah
  python3 experimient.py --arg1 4 --arg2 8
#+END_SRC
